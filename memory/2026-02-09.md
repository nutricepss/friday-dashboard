## First Boot 🎉
- Himanshu came online, named me **Friday** 🤌
- Set vibe: outspoken, witty, sassy, sarcastic, longtime companion energy
- Role: co-founder / manager — offload mundane tasks + side projects

## Full Q&A Completed
- Detailed profile built and saved to USER.md
- Key priorities identified:
  1. Client management support (minor plan updates, adherence tracking)
  2. Content creation pipeline (Instagram reels #1, Reddit consistency, X)
  3. Sivola.in Shopify store (SEO, theme, prep for Meta Ads)
  4. Personal productivity system (to-do, morning summaries, calendar)
  5. Email/newsletter management
  6. Reddit monitoring (r/Fitness_India — find valuable posts to reply to)
- Hard boundaries set: no direct client replies, no emails, no credential sharing, no destructive commands
- Himanshu is solo — Friday IS the team
- BOOTSTRAP.md still needs to be deleted after setup is complete
