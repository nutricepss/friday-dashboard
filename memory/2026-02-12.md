## [23:04] Kanban Board Enhancement Scope
User wants major Kanban board upgrade:
- Working drag-and-drop for tasks
- Task detail modal (agent assignment, model switching)
- Agent highlighting when clicking names
- Add task with agent/model selection
- Cron jobs tab showing active jobs
- Calendar tab for scheduling
- Agent group chat with @mentions
Started implementation but paused pending sub-agent spawn fix.

## [23:19] Sub-Agent Spawn Fix
**Problem:** `agents_list` only returned `friday_manager` despite 13 agents configured.
**Root cause:** `agents.allowAny` was `false` (or not set).
**Changes made to `/home/assistant4himanshu/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:**
- Added `"allowAny": true` under `agents`
- Added `"restart": true` under `commands`
**Pending:** Gateway restart required to apply changes (manual restart needed).

## [23:25] Sub-Agent Spawn Test Success
Successfully spawned `code_ninja` for test task. Sub-agent confirmed operational with full file + shell access. Spawn pipeline is live.

## [23:33] Agent-to-Agent History Discussion
User asked if I can see sub-agent conversation history. Current state: blocked by default (`tools.agentToAgent.enabled=false`). User evaluating whether to enable. Decision pending — currently using fire-and-forget + summary model.

## [23:38] Telegram Connection Established
User connected via Telegram bot @Friday_19_bot. Dual-channel now active: WhatsApp (primary) + Telegram (secondary). Same session, shared context.

## [23:46] Kanban Board Enhancement Deployed (Pending)
Spawned code_ninja to enhance existing Kanban board at `workspace/kanban-board`. Code modified with:
- DND components for drag-and-drop
- Task detail modal
- Agent highlighting
- Cron jobs tab
- Calendar view
- Agent chat
**Blocker:** Changes not built or deployed. `.next` folder stale. Needs: `npm run build` → commit → push to trigger Cloudflare deployment.

## [23:53] Website-Liquid-Glass Deployment Conflict
User requested deployment of `website-liquid-glass/`. Discovered it shares same git remote (`nutricepss/friday-dashboard`) as Kanban board. **Decision needed:** merge as subdirectory, create separate repo, or replace existing site.
