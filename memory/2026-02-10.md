## [22:05] NLP Content Generation System Built
- Location: `/home/assistant4himanshu/.openclaw/workspace/nlp/`
- Components:
  - `gather_data.py` - Uses `chirp search` to pull fitness/nutrition/D2C tweets
  - `prepare_training_data.py` - Cleans, categorizes, creates training format
  - `generate_content.py` - Generates tweets, replies, content ideas
  - `pipeline.py` - Master orchestration script
- Features:
  - 8 categories: fitness, nutrition, motivation, weight_loss, muscle_gain, d2c, ecommerce, growth
  - Template-based generation with real-world examples
  - Reply generation with context-aware responses
  - Zero API cost for inference (uses gathered data)
- Usage: `python nlp/scripts/pipeline.py generate --category fitness --count 10`
- Ready for integration via `sessions_spawn`

## [22:04] WhatsApp Integration Complete - Forward-Only Mode
- Bot number: +918287424708 (dedicated number for Friday)

## [22:43] SYSTEM.md Created - Session Initialization Rules
- Location: `/home/assistant4himanshu/.openclaw/workspace/SYSTEM.md`
- Purpose: Single source of truth for session behavior
- Key rules:
  1. Load only: SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
  2. DO NOT auto-load: MEMORY.md, session history, prior messages
  3. Use memory_search() + memory_get() on demand only
  4. Update memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md at end of session
- Updated AGENTS.md to reference SYSTEM.md as primary
- Includes: Model selection logic, tool usage rules, channel rules, hard boundaries

## [23:23] Multi-Model Setup Complete
- Added 8 new model configurations:
  1. **Deepseek V3** (`deepseek`) - Reasoning, analysis

  3. **Gemini 2.0 Flash** (`flash`) - Fast, cheap summaries
  4. **Gemini 2.0 Pro** (`gemini-pro`) - Complex tasks, vision
  5. **Claude Opus 4** (`opus`) - Complex reasoning
  6. **Claude Sonnet 4** (`sonnet`) - Balanced quality/speed
  7. **Claude Haiku 4** (`haiku`) - Quick, cheap replies

- Alias: `local`
- Usage: Heartbeat checks every 30 minutes
- Benefits: FREE (no API costs), private, fast for simple checks
- Total models now: 9 (8 cloud + 1 local)

## [23:57] Rate Limits & Budget Controls Added to optimization.md
- **Rate Limits:**
  - 5 seconds minimum between API calls
  - 10 seconds between web searches
  - Max 5 searches per batch, then 2-minute break
  - Batch similar work (one request for 10 leads, not 10 requests)
  - 429 error handling: STOP, wait 5 minutes, retry
- **Budget Controls:**
  - Daily: $5 (warning at 75% = $3.75)
  - Monthly: $70 (warning at 75% = $52.50)
  - Strict mode triggers when budget hit (use local/cheap models)
- Added reference in SYSTEM.md: "## How to Operate See OPTIMIZATION.md"

## [00:08] Memory Search & Context Pruning Optimized
- **Memory Search:**
