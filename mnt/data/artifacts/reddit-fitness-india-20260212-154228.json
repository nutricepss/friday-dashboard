I currently weigh 72kgs and my ideal weight is 65kgs. \nI'm cutting a bit of carbs and fat and doing a high protein diet. But sometimes my protein target isn't met so I want to get a protein powder to consume after the workout. Kindly suggest me some good ones under 3000. \nI used to consume ON when I was working out in the gym during 2019-2022. But had some rough years after that and I want to get back on track. "

I educated myself on calorie surplus, improved my diet, and started training consistently 4–5 days a week.\nStrength-wise, I’ve made solid progress. I’m lifting weights that once felt impossible. I can now match the same weight and reps as guys who’ve been training 1–2 years. That makes me proud.\nBut recently, I got comments from family saying I look “fat” or “off.” It made me question my bulk.\nThis is my first proper bulk.\nBe honest  does this look like a decent bulk so far? Should I continue, lean bulk, or start a cut? Any advice is appreciated."

Waking up is still a struggle, but once I’m there, the vibe is calm, no rush for machines, and workouts feel more focused. Energy stays surprisingly steady through the day, mood is better, and sleep has improved too.\n\nStill sore, still adjusting, but this routine feels sustainable so far. Anyone else who switched to morning workouts-does it get easier after a few weeks? "
