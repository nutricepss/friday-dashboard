"Here's the truth: most people over-supplement. You don't need 10 different pills. Focus on these 3 essentials:

1. **Protein** - Builds and repairs muscle
2. **Creatine** - Proven performance booster  
3. **Multivitamin** - Fills nutritional gaps

Stop the supplement overwhelm! 💊

Most fitness enthusiasts are drowning in pills they don't need. The truth? You only need 2-3 key supplements if your diet is on point.

Protein for muscle repair ✅
Creatine for performance ✅  
Multivitamin for nutritional gaps ✅

Everything else? Probably marketing hype.

Save this for when you're tempted to buy another "miracle" supplement that promises the world.

DM me "SUPPLEMENTS" if you want help creating a simple, effective supplement stack that actually works.
